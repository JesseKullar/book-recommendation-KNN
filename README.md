# book-recommendation-KNN
Part of a series of projects to attain my Machine Learning certification in Python. See Following: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jessekullar/machine-learning-with-python-v7

This algorithm uses K-Nearest Neighbors to determine book recommendations from a given title. The recommendations are determined through user reviews that have been submitted to the Book-Crossing Dataset (see: http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)
